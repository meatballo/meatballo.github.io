                                With a rising demand for personalized experiences in traditional, uniform workplaces, <b>this project

                            <p>Most lunch boxes include clasps, which offer a secure, leak-proof seal. Through two rounds of interviews, I found that sound matters a lot - 
                                most users disliked the clasps due to the noise it makes in a room. <div class="textbr"></div>Going the vent hole route was both a response to my research and a personal 
                                challenge :)

                            <p>This project affirmed my love
                                for the user/person - it was fun for me to learn about different mindsets and habits, and how our everyday objects
                                affect that.
                                Given more time, I'd reexplore utensil storage and CMF.

                                In all, my main focus for this project became <strong>sizing to everyday things:</strong> fitting into the backpack, fitting
                                a cleaning sponge, the curve of a spoon, and the hand. <br> As well as <strong>product promise:</strong> does the form promise comfort? 
                                Simplicity? Easy integration into routine?
