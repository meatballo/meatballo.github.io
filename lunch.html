                            The <strong>gasket lip</strong> helps the user take out the gasket for easy cleaning. The lid is made of HDPE clear plastic to allow the user to see
                            if there's any debris near the gasket.

                            The <strong>vent hole</strong> allows for a tight vacuum seal. The seal can be broken by pressing on the plastic button, and a silicone nub releases pressure. </p>

                            <p>Most lunch boxes include clasps, which offer a secure, leak-proof seal. Through two rounds of interviews, I found that sound matters a lot - 
                                most users disliked the clasps due to the noise it makes in a room. Going the vent hole route was both a response to my research as well as a personal

                                Those who want to begin packing: their motivators are to save money, eat healthier, and gain independence. <br>
                                Those who successfully pack regularly: their motivators are simply because they love cooking and packing their food. For them, 
                        preparing one's food is a ritual and joy.  </p>

                            <p>I began by seeing the options out there: what works across cultures? Why?
                            What were the reasons for each lunch carrier's design? For status, utility, ritualizing food, etc.?
                            <div class="textbr"></div> I focused on the idea of ritualizing food. This can be found in small differences in how people pack their
                            food: whether they throw their food all together or deliberately plate their meal.

                                I discovered that those who pack regularly look forward to almost all the motions: shopping, cooking, packing, eating... just
                            not so much on cleaning (understandably). From these, I gathered a summary of concrete pain points in their experience to implement into 
                        my design. </p>

                            <br>
                            <p> I chose a bright reddish-orange because it's 
                                not too dull to feel dirty from food, but warm-feeling to match the form.
                                The color placement indicates how the vacuum mechanism works, both the gasket and 
                                switch, so it's easier to understand. <div class="textbr"></div>The clear top allows the user to see their food, as well 
                            as to check the cleanliness of the gasket area. The body is opaque as most users did not like the appearance of food against glass.</p>

                            <p>This project affirmed my love
                                for the user/person - it was fun for me to learn about different mindsets and habits, and how our everyday objects
                                affect that.
                                Given more time, I'd reexplore utensil storage and CMF.

                                In all, my main focus for this project became <strong>sizing to everyday things:</strong> fitting into the backpack, fitting
                                a cleaning sponge, the curve of a spoon, and the hand. <br> As well as <strong>product promise:</strong> does the form promise comfort? 
                                Simplicity? Easy integration into routine?
