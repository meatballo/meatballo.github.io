                            <p>The speaker is meant to live on the nightstand, allowing for easy access from the bed.

                                There are three main interactions: <strong>on/off, volume, and white noise.</strong><br>
                                For white noise, the pebble is to be moved away from the center to add more 'texture' to the sound produced.
                                As more white noise is added, the user feels more texture as well. 
                                <div class="textbr"></div>
                                I combined on/off and volume into one motion: turning the whole form back and forth. This adheres to 
                                convention, so it's easy to understand.

                            <br>
                            <p> After a round of user interviews involving sleeping habits, I found that students
                                prefer sleeping to light music, a podcast, white noise, Youtube videos, etc. One of the biggest reasons was
                                to offer a distraction for sleep - neighbors may be too loud or phone too distracting. 
                                <div class="textbr"></div> Personally, I wanted this project to be a bit more experimental, so I opted for a 
                                less commercial design.

                            <br>
                            <p>
                               With personal intuition and a user survey, I found that sleep and sound are 
                                associated with marine forms and patterns. 
                                <div class="textbr"></div>
                                I created many moodboards, drew inspiration from <a href="https://www.johnedmark.com/" target="_blank" class="proj">John Edmark's</a> work,
                                and from the brand <a href="https://kinto-usa.com/collections" target="_blank" class="proj">Kinto</a>. From that, I focused both on form 
                                and interaction.

                            <p>I first defined the core interactions involved (on/off, volume, noise), then settled on motions for them.
                            <div class="textbr"></div> I allowed these interactions to dictate the form: what suggests an action? Should it be
                            difficult to decipher to allow some play?

                            <p>Again, this was a fun, exploratory project, so I looked into less-conventional speaker shapes.
                            <div class="textbr"></div> Here, I was debating between <b>abstract interactions vs. known, canon ones (button)</b>.
