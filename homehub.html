                            <p>Through affinity mapping, I found that different types of conversations are greatly affected by the environment, 
                                and both deep and light conversations are important for being connected.

                                A key insight was: <b>conversations are more comfortable for teens if they're done casually.</b> That could mean no eye-contact, each person doing something
                                passively (cooking, driving), or non-verbal communication.
