                                   difficult to recognize why their child isn't communicating.

                                Determining the amount of control over a technology was my main challenge. The product could have been a phone, 
                                but blocking certain functionalities helps steer the conversation away from the digital screen.

                            <p>Landing on an idea that addressed <b>lowering the barrier for conversation,</b> I user tested with a house of
                                college students (couldn't get a family to test in-person). 
                                <div class="textbr"></div>
                                It was well-received in that it did facilitate conversations outside the paper and
                                between drawings as well. The students liked to draw, then do a big reveal at the end
                                of their drawing to the others, which I took into mind to make the design more portable. To note, these students may be more comfortable drawing than the average person.
