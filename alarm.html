                            <br>
                            <p>Operation room fires are rare, but deadly.
                            <div class="textbr"></div>
                            The oxygen tanks, personnel, and patient are all key factors to consider. In the case the fire gets out of control, the surgeons must prep the patient first, then rush out the OR. 
                            <div class="textbr"></div>
                            Speed and easy accessibility are key in an operating room emergency. </p>

                            <br>
                            <p>I was lucky enough to speak with a couple people who’ve worked in an OR/hospital setting.
                                <div class="textbr"></div>
                                The main concern with OR fires is either putting the fire out or rushing the patient out as quickly as possible. This means an ideal spot for the alarm would be within the room, so that a team member can alert others of the situation. </p>

                            <br>
                            <p>The alarm should be <strong>quick</strong>: <br>
                                <h5>Low cognitive load allows for faster reaction time</h5>
                                <h5>A no-hand activation would free the person to perform other tasks</h5>
                                <div class="textbr"></div>
                                The alarm should be <h3>recognizable</h3>:<br>
                                <h5>A contrasting form will help personnel locate the alarm</h5>
                                <div class="textbr"></div>
                                Lastly, the alarm should protect from accidental triggers while still being easily activated.</p>

                            <br>
                            <p>I explored different potential interactions as I slowly narrowed down my concept. 
                                <div class="textbr"></div>
                                For the <strong>hand</strong>, it would likely be occupied + is unconventional for an OR setting. OR’s have buttons for emergencies, rather than intricate pulls. 
                                <div class="textbr"></div>
                                For the <strong>knee/foot</strong>, I was afraid that an alarm out of eyesight would be difficult to notice in an emergency. </p>

                                Here, I focused on visual cues + affordances as well as protecting from accidental triggering. I also did some exploration into what makes a button a button; such as door pushes, stop buttons, etc. </p>

                            <p>The alarm’s <strong>tilt</strong> on the wall. <br>
                                This tilt presents the alarm to the user, so that the fear of triggering an alarm is mitigated.
                                <div class="textbr"></div>
                                Alarm <strong>protective measures</strong>.<br>
                                The jut out of the wall helps prevent placement of equipment in front of it, and includes a lip/guard at the base to stop accidental triggers.
                                <div class="textbr"></div>
                                Rather than a straight button, it’s a <strong>hinge</strong>.<br>
                                This allows for the light placement, which signals to the user that the alarm is activated. Additionally, a hinge compliments the tilted form without compromising the action.
                                <div class="textbr"></div>
                                Finally, the <strong>scale</strong>.<br>
                                A smaller, more conventional alarm suggested hand-usage rather than an elbow.

                            <p> The hinge and shell are friction-fit so that the button stays down after being pressed. I also added ribs within the model for some tactile feedback when the button’s pressed.

                                LEDs fit in clear acrylic so that the light is distributed across the alarm, and copper tape completes the circuit after pressing.
