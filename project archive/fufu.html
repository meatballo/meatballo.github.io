                             Fufu is a West African food that makes up the carbs of a meal. It's traditionally made of pounded, fermented cassava, which is 
                             then blended, cooked, and stirred until a desired silky consistency. Alternatives to cassava, such as oats and yams, have been 
                             growing in popularity. </p>

                                 Given that fufu is West African, we looked into cookware used in Ghana to find form inspiration.

                                The final visuals + model were created for presenting the concept of this product, so
                                specificities in the motor, heat plate, and electronics were not modeled, just considered.

                            <p>FufuChef includes a lid with a <strong> locking mechanism</strong> and <strong>water hole</strong>.
                            <div class="textbr"></div>
                            The <strong>locking mechanism</strong> secures the lid on FufuChef, aligning with existing locking cues (righty tighty, lefty loosey).
                            The lid also has a slight square shape to cue the user to lock the cap in place. 
                            <div class="textbr"></div>
                            The <strong>vent hole</strong> allows for the user to pour more water in during cooking as per their fufu texture preference.</p>

                            <br>
                            <p> Color, material, and finish were mostly decided by our client as they had a clear idea on the 
                                look of the finished product.

                                <div class="textbr"></div>
                                I think this was a very lucky project to stumble upon - I love cooking (especially foods outside my culture),
                                and I was able to collaborate with great people. This project was unfortunately rushed, given that our client had
                                a competition deadline, so there was not much time given to physical prototyping. 
                                <div class="textbr"></div>
                                If given more time, I would like to test sizing of the UI panel on the model as well as overall scale.
